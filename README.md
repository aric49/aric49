- 👋 Hi, I’m Aric Renzo, GitHub handle: @aric49. I'm an IT DevOps, Operations, and Cloud Engineer.  I specialize in containers, automation, and Cloud infrastructure best practices.
- 👀 I’m interested in containers (Kubernetes, Docker, Podman, OpenShift, Serverless container platforms), automation (Chef, Puppet, Salt, Ansible, Terraform, Python), and overall improving the lives of IT operations engineers by allowing them to sleep more and make fewer mistakes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - [ ] Leveraging and optimizing serverless databases
  - [ ] Big Data concepts 
  - [X] Best practices for leveraging Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) at scale
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects involving operations, Cloud, and containerization technologies.
